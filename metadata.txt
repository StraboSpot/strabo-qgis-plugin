about=StraboSpot is a project comprised of a mobile application for collection of geologic data in the field and an online, graph database for data storage and sharing. This plug-in interacts with the online database through a series of REST commands (GET and POST) in order to download and upload a user's Strabo-generated data in GeoJson form for use in QGIS.
